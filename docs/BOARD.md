# The board — what is happening right now

**This file is the state of record.** It is true *before* any report reaches the
owner. A successor session must be able to act within minutes from this file plus
`git log --oneline -10 origin/main` and `git worktree list`.

**One screen, overwritten in place.** A record that no longer describes the present
belongs in the decision ledger or nowhere.

## The contract

1. **Updated in the same commit as the landing it records.**
2. **True BEFORE the dispatcher reports to the owner.** If the session dies the
   second after that report, a successor must be able to act from this file, the
   ledger, and git alone.
3. **Every record names something checkable** — sha, branch, worktree, session id,
   path. "Probably fine" is not a record.
4. **Session start = reconcile first** (`bash scripts/board.sh`). Read it, check it
   against reality, fix what lied, report ONE line, and only then dispatch.
5. **Reconcile against the REMOTE branch, never a stale local one.** A landing once
   read as "unlanded" for hours while it was pushed and five commits ahead of a
   stale local branch.

## Record vocabulary

One line per record, `PREFIX | field=value | …`, so a query is a `grep` and the
answer is a line, not a paragraph.

| Prefix | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `reconciled: <sha> · <timestamp>` | the commit the rest of this file was checked against |
| `SESSION` | an actor that may dispatch (id, model, state) |
| `PROBE` | a read-only agent in flight and the question it answers |
| `IN-FLIGHT` | a writer: row, session, worktree, branch, base, **state**, and the full scope |
| `LANDED` | a verified landing: row, sha, **the dispatcher's own verification numbers**, what was retired, the docs amended |
| `QUEUE` | owner requests and known debt not yet dispatched, with the row number reserved |
| `QUEUE-CLOSED` | a queue line whose scope is consumed (kept one screen, then dropped) |
| `TRAP` | a mistake that actually happened, with the rule that prevents it |
| `GUARD` | a mechanism protecting the process (host, memory, compaction) and how to verify it |
| `RECOVERY` | where a successor finds lost context |

---

## Board

```
reconciled: 2e44eaf · 2026-09-27T16:10Z — the gated landing commit, and now MACHINE-VERIFIED:
  `bash scripts/board.sh` → BOARD RECONCILED (exit 0), reporting "2e44eaf is on origin/main" and
  "2e44eaf is an ancestor of the remote". (An earlier line here read "20c132d · 2026-09-27T17:45Z",
  which was LOCAL time mislabelled as Z — the dispatcher's error, corrected rather than quietly.)

SESSION | id=session-dcd6176e-b4b9-4759-b64d-4c90d3495dfa | role=dispatcher (chief of staff)
  | state=writer LANDED row 19; dispatcher verification of the pushed landing is OWED
  | goal=goal-1f2f2e27-ed8d-470d-8499-c1eeed63b3b6 (paused; untouched since creation)
  | host=12 cores · 23Gi RAM · load 0.6 · / has 506GB free
  | remote=https://github.com/ArndRosemeier/ServerStore.git — PUBLIC, owner-created 2026-09-27.
  |   The row-19 landing is pushed to origin/main; the LANDED row below names its sha.

(no IN-FLIGHT writers — the slice-2 writer LANDED its work on branch `feat/core` and
pushed it; the LANDED row below is the record, and the dispatcher re-verifies before
retiring the worktree and branch.)

NOTE | tsconfig includes tests/ only. src/ arrives with the first FEATURE slice (the multi-store
  core); inventing a dead module now would be vanity, and the ledger records it as unproven.
NOTE | Toolbox's machinery MOVED (now docs/README.md, WAY-OF-WORKING.md, BOARD, DECISION-LEDGER,
  SEAM-INDEX, TESTING, GATE, BRIEF + a 4-file scaffold). We have the minimum it names — board,
  ledger, brief, ONE gate, a lock — and deliberately have NO SEAM-INDEX and NO TESTING doc yet:
  there is no seam and no behaviour to record. Both land with the first feature slice.

QUEUE | row=7 | exposure DECIDED (one subdomain + one master key). Ingress NOT added yet: it needs
  the tunnel restart (TRAP t1) and the owner's go-ahead at that moment.
QUEUE | row=12 | hostname CONFIRMED by the owner 2026-09-27: store.futuremagic.de. Nothing is exposed
  yet; adding the ingress needs the tunnel restart (TRAP t1) and his go-ahead at that moment.
QUEUE-CLOSED | row=16 | RESOLVED 2026-09-27: the owner created a PUBLIC repo instead and the first
  push landed (a20fc95 == origin/main). The private `Store` repo is orphaned; deleting it is
  housekeeping on the owner's side, nothing here points at it.
QUEUE | row=18 | Public visibility, DOWNGRADED by the dispatcher (ledger row 20). The docs do describe
  the live perimeter in plain language, but the only perimeter is a 256-bit key stored hashed and the
  hostname is discoverable via DNS/CT logs anyway, so obscurity does no work here. Public is the
  recommended default; the case for private is tidiness, not security.
QUEUE | row=20 | IF the repo is ever made private, the CREDENTIAL must change first: it is a classic
  PAT with `x-oauth-scopes: public_repo, workflow` and no `repo`, so a private repo would 403. The
  replacement must be written to BOTH ~/.git-credentials AND
  ~/projects/Campaigner/.git/github-credentials (byte-identical today; it wins inside Campaigner).
  BlasterMaster's helper just points at the global file and follows a rotation automatically.
QUEUE | row=21 | SLICE 3 (small, SERIALIZED after the core lands — it touches the gate while a writer runs,
  which is exactly the sequencing rule): a SECRET TRIPWIRE, because a public repo turns "we won't push
  the key" from an intention into something that must be enforced. Scan the TRACKED tree for token
  shapes that never appear in fixtures (`ghp_`, `github_pat_`, `-----BEGIN * PRIVATE KEY-----`, and
  the literal host token value), and assert no data-root path or `*.db` file is tracked; add
  `*.db`/`*.sqlite` to .gitignore. Rejected: scanning for `ssk_`-shaped strings — the writer's own
  fixtures are necessarily key-shaped, so it would either red on the tests or have to exclude the
  very files most likely to hide a real leak.
QUEUE | row=17 | the reconciler defect (row 15) is STILL upstream at Toolbox head 824a8b5 —
  scaffold/scripts/board.sh:53 and :60 keep the bare `git rev-parse`. Toolbox is outside this
  project, so it needs the owner's word before anyone touches it.
QUEUE | row=none | HTTP framework (Hono vs Fastify) — deliberately deferred to the first feature slice.
QUEUE | row=none | FIRST FEATURE SLICE: multi-store core — store registry + master store + access-key
  auth (hashed, prefixed, scoped) + PUT/GET, per ledger rows 5, 6, 10.
QUEUE | row=none | systemd --user unit + cloudflared ingress for the live subdomain.

TRAP | t1 | Adding a hostname to /etc/cloudflared/config.yml REQUIRES RESTARTING the tunnel — a few
  | seconds in which dsh.futuremagic.de (the owner's own GUI), opencode.futuremagic.de and
  | openclaw.futuremagic.de all drop. Passwordless sudo works, so this line is the only guard.
TRAP | t2 | Two FOREIGN processes were mid-run at reconcile in BlasterMaster/worktrees/dup-tripwire
  | (`npm run gate`, `npm run build`). The gate lock is PER-REPO, so it does not exclude a peer
  | project's suite; check pgrep / board.sh before a big run.

GUARD | g1 | Never bind to 0.0.0.0. Loopback + tunnel is how every service on this box is exposed
  | (precedent: apps-web.service).
GUARD | g2 | A long check never runs in the foreground in the dispatcher session; a WRITER runs its
  | own gate IN-TURN, because a subagent's background jobs die with its turn.
GUARD | g3 | Memory ceiling: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — the suite is trivial, so there is nothing to
  | bound. Debt, not a claim. It lands with the first suite that is not.
GUARD | g4 | The suite lock is per-repo (`.gate-lock` at the git common dir). Verify: run the gate
  | twice — the second run exits 9 and is VOID. It does NOT exclude a peer project's suite.

  | verify=THE WRITER'S OWN, in-turn: `bash scripts/gate.sh` → exit 0 (GREEN) · 6 test files ·
  | 52 tests · ~2.0s · raw log .gate-logs/gate.log · peak load < 1, ~2s wall, no memory ceiling

  | 99367879…→55bf1568… RED on the strip-only-Node runtime pin. Control after restore: GREEN.
  | No VOID probe. Full transcript: checkpoints/differential.out.
  | evidence beyond the suite=the surface was probed against a REAL bound server: /healthz 200,
  | `pnpm run admin:key` minted a key the live API accepted as admin, PUT/GET over loopback,
  | `ss -ltn` showed 127.0.0.1:8477 ONLY, port free after kill. That probe found a defect the
  | 49-test suite could not: a TS parameter property in `Auth` crashed `pnpm run serve` under
  | node --experimental-strip-types while vitest transpiled it happily. Fixed, and pinned by
  | tests/runtime.test.ts.
  | retired=NOT yet — worktree worktrees/core and branch feat/core are the dispatcher's to retire
  | after ITS OWN verification. This writer does not retire itself.
  | docs=ledger row 19 (appended) · docs/SEAM-INDEX.md (created) · docs/TESTING.md (created) ·
  | this board | COPIES: 1 — checked, no duplication (grepped: key format and parsing — one site
  | in src/core/keys.ts; name/scope/permission validation — one site in src/core/validate.ts;
  | error code→status — one site in src/core/errors.ts; blob paths — one site in
  | src/storage/fs.ts; the data root is joined to a path in exactly one module).
  | note=the failed test-helper parse `raw.split("_")[1]` is recorded in the seam index gotchas:
  | base64url ids can start with `_`, so the correct helper is keyIdFromRaw().

LANDED | row=14 | sha=2e44eaf | verify=MY OWN: cheap tier exit 2 (which is NOT a pass) + full gate

LANDED | row=15 | sha=2e44eaf | verify=MY OWN: `git rev-parse no-such-remote/main`
  | prints the ref back and exits 128 (captured in the session); scripts/board.sh now prints
  | CANNOT LOOK and exits 1 for BOTH the default case (no origin exists) and the forced-missing
  | case, where it previously blamed the record | arms=the cannot-look PIN was RED before the fix
  | and GREEN after | retired=nothing | docs=ledger row 15
  | note=DIVERGENCE: our board.sh is no longer byte-identical to the Toolbox scaffold.
```

## Guards

- **`GUARD` — the suite lock.** `scripts/gate.sh` takes an atomic `mkdir` lock; a
  second run is refused (exit 9) and is VOID. Pinned by
  `tests/gate.test.ts`.
- **`GUARD` — the memory ceiling.** See `g3` — not implemented yet, and said so.

## Recovery pointers

- Repo / remote / branch: `/home/administrator/projects/ServerStore` · (none yet) · `main`
- The gate command and its exit codes (`0` green · `1` failed · `2` cheap only ·
  `9` refused, VOID): `bash scripts/gate.sh`
- Where the raw logs live: `.gate-logs/gate.log` (gitignored)
- Open writer branches/worktrees: `git worktree list` · `git branch -a`

## Traps (each with the rule that prevents it)

- `TRAP t1` — the tunnel restart drops the owner's own GUI for a few seconds. Rule:
  never add a hostname silently; ask at the moment.
- `TRAP t2` — the lock is per-repo. Rule: check `pgrep`/`board.sh` before an
  expensive run, because a peer project's suite is not excluded by our lock.
